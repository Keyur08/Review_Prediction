# Review_Prediction
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can analyze product reviews and determine the sentiment expressed by customers towards the product (positive, negative, or neutral). Sentiment analysis can help businesses understand customer feedback better and make data-driven decisions to improve their products and services.
